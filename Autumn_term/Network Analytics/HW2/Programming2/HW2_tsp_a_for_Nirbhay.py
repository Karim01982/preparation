# The data HW2_tsp.txt contains latitude and longitude data of 38 cities in a country in Africa (Djibouti).
# Calculate the distance matrix (use an approximation like here which is quite accurate for short distances; 
# or use packages like haversine or geopy).
# The x and y-cordinates are the latitude and longitude in decimal form multiplied by 1000.
# EUC_2D means take these as Cartesian co-ordinates.
# Can also use haversine treating them as longitude and latitude.
# You are free to use any other functions you find.

# b. (5 points) Use the or-tools traveling salesman routine to find a tour of the 38 cities.  
# If it is not finding a tour fast enough, try a subset of 10 cities (then 15 and so on).  
# My suggestion is to try to understand the solved example given there and try to recreate it for this data.  




# c. [Challenge problem., 10 points]  The most powerful integer programming solver is Gurobi (along with CPLEX).  
# They give a free one year license if you download and install from a University IP address.  
# Use the most powerful computer you have in your group (cores and memory).  Connect with the Python interface of Gurobi and find an optimal tour using the sub-tour elimination integer programming formulation we did in class.  
# You cannot generate all the sub-tour elimination constraints at once (too many). 
# Instead,  i. Start with a problem with only the degree =2 constraints.   
# ii. Check the resulting solution for sub-tours.  If there is a sub-tour, add the sub-tour elimination constraints corresponding to a cut defined by the sub-tour (i.e. you are eliminating that sub-tour in the next round).   
# iii. Repeat till you find a tour (in which case, it is optimal).    Make sure you do not discard the solution from the previous round, but start from what you had found.  
# This method of generating constraints on the fly is suitable when the number of constraints are exponential in the problem size.  
# The dual version of this is called column generation.  
# Compare the optimal solution with the or-tools solution.  The optimal tour is here.  






# d. Plot the resulting tour on the scatter plot
