1. I will convert the pages file to doc file and upload after ML class
2. This needs to be succinct! Sorry for my poor English
3. I deleted the clustering part because it's too long but I really want to add a community clustering part talking about the two groups
4. Also I'm thinking whether we need to add a summary or not, although it's just a 1.6 (5/3) points question and the TA only marks our homework depending on whether we cover what the lecturer asked
5. There are lots of graphs created in my code which are not included in the pdf. We could always review and just pick the ones we want to add (takes up a lot of space though)
6. The size/font of graphs might need to be adjusted
